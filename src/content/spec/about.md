# Hey, I’m Anshuman 👨‍💻

Currently trying to answer two questions:
1. How do we build **intelligence** that actually understands us?
2. And what kind of life is worth living while doing that?

I’m a CS undergrad from India, working toward a life that blends **research**, **aesthetics**, and **meaning** — the kind where your code runs, your coffee’s hot, and your ideas might just matter.

---

## 🔭 Right now, I’m focused on:

- 📘 **Mastering ML foundations**  
  (CS229, CS231N, CS224N — the real deal, not the YouTube-summary kind)

- 🧪 **Building & replicating ML projects**  
  Especially in **probabilistic models** and **value alignment** — things that can break, fail, or surprise me.

- ✍️ **Documenting my learning publicly**  
  Not because I want to be an “influencer,” but because clarity scales.

- 🌍 **Applying for elite research internships in Europe**  
  ETH Zurich is the dream. But I’m building my way in — with code, ideas, and this blog.

---

## 🧠 What keeps me up at night?

- Alignment, consciousness, cognition  
- Simulation theory and Gödel’s incompleteness  
- The beauty of first principles  
- Whether intelligence is actually understandable  

---

## 🎯 Long term?

I want to contribute to AI that’s **safe**, **elegant**, and **aligned with human values**.  
Not just optimized for clicks — but for meaning.

If you're working on alignment, ML research, or just love building cool things —  
reach out. I don’t bite.
