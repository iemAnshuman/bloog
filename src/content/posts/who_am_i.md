## Who Am I?

Maybe I’m human. Or maybe I’m just a shadow pretending to be one. Carbon atoms, water, neurons—star dust that got lucky. Lucky enough to somehow… notice itself.
Self-awareness. That grand illusion. That voice in my head saying *I am*. But is it real? Or just another line of code in a program that was designed to say *I am*?

If a machine said “I feel,” would we believe it?
If I stop feeling, stop questioning, stop watching myself—do I stop being human?
Is *being human* just about having this recursive loop of *“I know that I know that I exist”*?

Or maybe I’m not even here.
Maybe I’m someone else's hallucination.
Maybe I’m a butterfly dreaming of a boy.
Or a dream inside an android’s hard-coded subconscious.
Wait—can androids even dream?
What *is* a dream anyway?
A glitch in memory? A story stitched by a sleeping brain?
An echo of something I wanted but couldn’t say?

Maybe I’m not real.
Maybe none of this is.
Maybe we’re just a tape, a sequence of frames running in a simulation nested within a simulation, three layers deep, projected for the idle amusement of some fourth-dimensional beings munching on alien popcorn.
Maybe they’re laughing at this paragraph right now.
Maybe this question is a feature.
Maybe it’s a bug.

But does it matter?

If I’m a dream, then it’s a vivid one.
If I’m a lie, it’s a damn beautiful lie.
If none of this is real, then pain still hurts, music still moves me, and silence still feels holy.
So maybe *being real* isn’t the point.
Maybe *feeling real* is.

Maybe I don't need an answer.
Maybe I just need to keep asking.

Who am I?
