This might be the single most important question you could tackle early in life. First off, let’s accept there is always an answer—even if it feels elusive. But why does this question matter so much? Sure, there are other profound questions like, “What is life?” or “What is the meaning of life?” or even “Why are we here?” But imagine we actually got an answer: say life is a simulation, and your entire purpose is to eat apples. Even if that were true, would you choose to do nothing but eat apples? Probably not. So maybe the answers to those questions aren't as crucial as we think. What really matters, perhaps, is figuring out how to live your life well. But here’s another snag—what exactly is a "good" life? With endless hedonistic pleasures available, defining a good life becomes incredibly complicated. Most people default to happiness as a metric, but if the point isn't solely happiness, then what? Suffering certainly isn't it—that would be too harsh and meaningless. You see the problem? Maybe a better question is: what makes a life truly worth living? For some, it’s family; for others, it's relationships, personal achievements, or finding balance. Everyone has a different perspective.

Let’s try approaching this logically:

If we're defining the "worth" of life, we're assuming life is something measurable. But how do we measure life? Duration? Quality? Both seem inadequate on their own. Logically, value must consider subjective factors (personal happiness, satisfaction, fulfillment) and objective factors (health, productivity, societal contribution). Given the complexity of human experience, subjective perceptions naturally become central—your internal perception fundamentally shapes how worthwhile you feel your life is.

People generally value coherence and consistency between their beliefs and actions—this alignment brings psychological comfort and clarity. If your actions contradict your beliefs, discomfort follows, eroding your life's perceived worth. So logically, coherence between who you are and what you do is vital.

Next, consider meaning. Meaning is essential because it stitches life's disparate events into a cohesive narrative. Without meaning, life fragments into disconnected, confusing episodes. Logically, a clear purpose provides direction, turning experiences into coherent, meaningful parts of your personal narrative.

Another critical piece is fulfillment. Humans naturally seek fulfillment through achieving goals and personal growth. Logically, fulfillment emerges as you set, pursue, and achieve meaningful objectives. Overcoming challenges provides lasting satisfaction, logically enhancing the perceived value of life.

Relationships also logically elevate life's worth. Humans, being inherently social, derive immense value from authentic connections. These genuine relationships—marked by trust, empathy, and mutual growth—dramatically improve life's perceived quality and depth.

Contributions matter too. Making a positive impact, whether on others or society, logically adds significant value. Knowing your existence improves lives or advances society gives profound meaning and worth to your life.

Authenticity logically matters because inauthenticity generates internal conflict. Aligning your external actions with your internal identity resolves psychological tension, logically enhancing your emotional health and overall life satisfaction.

Lastly, resilience logically addresses life's unpredictability. Life inevitably includes adversity, and resilience—the ability to effectively adapt to difficult conditions—ensures challenges become opportunities for growth, logically increasing life's value.

Ultimately, examining life logically shows us that coherence, meaningful purpose, fulfillment, authentic relationships, contributions, authenticity, and resilience collectively define what makes a life genuinely worth living.
